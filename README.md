# PII Detection and Anonymization in Financial Documents
A scalable framework integrating hybrid rule-based NLP and Machine Learning approaches for detecting and anonymizing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in financial documents. Achieves high precision, recall, and accuracy while preserving document readability.

## Overview
This project proposes a hybrid method combining pattern-based detection with a custom-trained spaCy NER model for robust PII detection and anonymization. It handles sensitive fields like names, phone numbers, emails, addresses, SSNs, credit card numbers, URLs, and company names across structured and unstructured financial texts.

## Features
1. Hybrid Rule-Based + ML-Based PII Detection
2. Anonymization with Placeholder Substitution
3. Synthetic Dataset Generation with Contextual Embedding
4. Real-world Financial Document Testing
5. Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Accuracy Evaluation
6. Fully Documented Training and Anonymization Pipelines
